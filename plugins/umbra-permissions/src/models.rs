//! The six permission data models.
//!
//! All six tables are namespaced under the "permissions" plugin prefix so they
//! don't collide with user models or other plugins. Explicit `table = "..."`
//! attributes are used to get the exact table names we want (the macro's default
//! snake_case would produce `permissions_content_type` instead of
//! `permissions_contenttype`, etc.).
//!
//! | Struct | Table |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ContentType` | `permissions_contenttype` |
//! | `Permission` | `permissions_permission` |
//! | `Group` | `permissions_group` |
//! | `GroupPermission` | `permissions_grouppermission` |
//! | `UserGroup` | `permissions_usergroup` |
//! | `UserPermission` | `permissions_userpermission` |
//!
//! `user_id` in `UserGroup` and `UserPermission` is `i64` (not
//! `ForeignKey<U>`) to keep the data model generic — we don't tie to a
//! concrete user type, so any `UserModel` implementation works.
//!
//! ## Edit / no-edit policy
//!
//! The rule is "lock framework-managed rows, leave user-created rows
//! editable." That splits along table boundaries:
//!
//! - **Framework-managed**: `ContentType` rows (auto-seeded one-per-model
//!   at boot) and the *codename* + *content_type_id* of every `Permission`
//!   row (the standard `add_X` / `change_X` / `delete_X` / `view_X` set is
//!   auto-seeded, and renaming a codename invalidates every
//!   `has_permission(...)` check in user code). Both stay `#[umbra(noedit)]`
//!   — the admin renders them read-only.
//!
//! - **User-created**: every row in `Group`, `GroupPermission`, `UserGroup`,
//!   `UserPermission` is something a staff user added through the admin
//!   to wire authorisation. Those rows MUST stay editable so the admin
//!   can reassign permissions and group memberships. They had `noedit`
//!   markers in an earlier pass; #61.1 reverts them.
//!
//! | Table | Editable columns | No-edit columns |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `ContentType` | (none — system-managed at boot) | `app_label`, `model` |
//! | `Permission` | `name` (human label) | `content_type_id`, `codename` |
//! | `Group` | `name`, `description` | (none) |
//! | `GroupPermission` | `group_id`, `permission_id` | (none — user-defined data) |
//! | `UserGroup` | `user_id`, `group_id` | (none — user-defined data) |
//! | `UserPermission` | `user_id`, `permission_id` | (none — user-defined data) |
//!
//! The `noedit` attribute is metadata only (it lands in `ModelMeta`, not in
//! the DDL), so adding or removing it doesn't dirty any existing schema.
