//! The migration engine — the north star.
//!
//! Implements the **declare → migrate → change → migrate** cycle from
//! `arch.md §0`. Users declare or change a model, run `migrate`, and the
//! framework either generates the missing migration file (via `make`)
//! or applies pending migration files (via `run`).
//!
//! At M5 (this milestone) the surface ships:
//!
//! - A process-wide [`ModelRegistry`] populated by
//!   `App::builder().model::<T>()`.
//! - A [`Snapshot`] of every registered model's metadata, JSON-
//!   serialisable so it can live inside a migration file's
//!   `snapshot_after`.
//! - An [`Operation`] enum with the two minimum-viable ops:
//!   [`Operation::CreateTable`] and [`Operation::DropTable`]. Column-
//!   level ops (`AddColumn`, `DropColumn`, `AlterColumn`) land at M5.1;
//!   they need finer-grained diff logic than M5 v1 ships.
//! - A [`MigrationFile`] format (one JSON file per migration) carrying
//!   `id`, `operations`, and `snapshot_after`.
//! - The `umbra_migrations` tracking table (one row per applied
//!   migration, keyed by `(plugin, name)`).
//! - High-level entry points: [`make`], [`run`], [`show`].
//!
//! Reserved for M5.1+:
//!
//! - Column-level ops (`AddColumn`, `DropColumn`, `AlterColumn`).
//! - Rename-detection vs drop+add disambiguation (spec 06 §M8).
//! - `RunSql` / `RunCode` data-migration ops.
//! - Squashing, `--fake`, `--fake-initial` (PRD F-MIG-6 P2).
//! - Cross-plugin migration dependencies (needs M7 Plugin contract).
//!
//! See `docs/specs/06-migration-engine.md` for the full target shape.
